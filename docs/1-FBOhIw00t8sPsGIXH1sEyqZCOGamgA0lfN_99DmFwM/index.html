                        <p>Classic New Orleans institutions, like the Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival at the Fairgrounds and the St. Augustine High School Marching 100 Band, are housed in the Seventh Ward. It’s the birthplace of renowned musicians like Buddie Petit and Lorenzo Tio, Jr., and it’s one of the city’s oldest neighborhoods, ripe with colorful shotgun homes.</p>
<p>But for local New Orleanians, short-term rental properties are threatening affordable housing, especially in low-income and historic neighborhoods like the Seventh Ward, especially considering its proximity to tourist attractions in the French Quarter. And thousands of these properties are likely operating illegally, despite the city’s attempts to crack down on these rentals in 2019.</p>

<p>Almost 90% of short-term rental properties that advertised active listings in the past month on third party sites like AirBnB and VRBO aren’t registered with the  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://data.nola.gov/Housing-Land-Use-and-Blight/Vacation-Rentals-Hotels-B-B-short-term-rentals-etc/rbhq-zbz9&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552746000&usg=AOvVaw3sg45a_7un3WzWhdBdU-dJ'>City of New Orleans’ Bureau of Revenue, Safety and Permits</a> , according to  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.airdna.co/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552747000&usg=AOvVaw3UG2oSqsijrQ2yZwdW77eL'>data from AirDNA</a> , a company that tracks data on the short-term rental market. And most of these properties are concentrated in nine of the city’s 70 neighborhoods.</p>

<p>The rise in short-term rentals and the accompanying consequences aren’t unique to New Orleans, but the historic and demographic makeup of the neighborhoods most affected makes the problem more pronounced, said Cashauna Hill, executive director of the  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.lafairhousing.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552748000&usg=AOvVaw1f7HhGuJzB14ll4E8UEieT'>Louisiana Fair Housing Action Center.</a></p>
<p>New Orleans is home to some of the oldest, majority Black neighborhoods in the city, including areas like the Treme, Marigny and the Seventh Ward, Hill said. These neighborhoods have become targets for short-term rental conversions, making it more difficult for permanent residents to find affordable housing.</p>
<p>“In particular, lower income, majority Black neighborhoods that have smaller landlords with less resources, especially those neighborhoods on the edge of gentrification, are especially vulnerable to the short-term rental market causing displacement,” Hill said.</p>
<p>And many of the long-term residents of these neighborhoods may not be able to relocate to communities in neighboring parishes if they rely on public transportation, Hill said. Neither Jefferson Parish or St. Bernard Parish receives service from the city’s bus system.</p>
<p>“There's no regional transportation or really no system that connects us officially with other communities that are nearby,” Hill said. “And so given that there's not easy access for people to find housing in these other communities, it's a little more when short-term rentals, push people out of the New Orleans housing market, because if they have to leave the city, they really are quite disconnected from the community that they've been a part of for a long time.”</p>
<p>But for property owners, renting out their spare rooms, guest houses or entire units in their building each weekend generates more income than a long term lease to a permanent resident.</p>
<p>In the Seventh Ward, the average rent price for a two-bedroom apartment is around $1,000 - about $32 a night, said Breonne DeDecker, a Seventh Ward resident and the program director of a housing rights organization in New Orleans,  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.jpnsi.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552749000&usg=AOvVaw0iFvOKwvVGiPfXIx48ZXtV'>Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiativ</a> e. But as a short-term rental, that same property could go for $200 per night, which means owners can earn an entire month’s rent in five days.</p>
<p>“There's a massive difference in what you can make renting out a house as a short term rental, compared to what you will make if you rent it out to an actual New Orleanian,” DeDecker said. “In some neighborhoods, we're talking a rent gap of $1,000 a month, if not more.”</p>

<script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();</script>

<p>And the majority of residents in these neighborhoods are renters, according to  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.datacenterresearch.org/data-resources/neighborhood-data/district-4/seventh-ward/%23downloads&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552750000&usg=AOvVaw3ekUajVCe6NBLg_pBhns78'>data from The Data Center</a> , an organization that analyzes data on Southeast Louisiana from the Census and American Community Surveys. In the Seventh Ward, 67% of housing units are occupied by renters, and 74% of renters are spending a third of their income or higher on rent.</p>
<p>Back in 2016, the city legalized short-term rental property without any significant regulations, and the short-term rental market exploded, said DeDecker. To combat the early boom, the city introduced regulations in 2019 that primarily aimed to cut down on properties owned and operated by out-of-state residents and large commercial owners, including mandating that websites like AirBnB remove listings no longer in compliance with city regulations, DeDecker said. The city also imposed additional taxes for short-term rental property owners.</p>
<p>The new regulations came with caveats, DeDecker said. While the rules restricted commercial owners to converting only 25% of units in the building to short-term rentals, existing buildings with short-term rentals exceeding the cap are allowed to continue operating those properties. And an additional four months passed before the regulations took effect on December 1, 2019, allowing owners to file applications for properties that would soon be considered noncompliant.</p>
<p>But even with additional regulations, short-term rentals are still running rampant, as the city has yet to enforce the existing restrictions. Only 12 days after the regulations went into effect, a cyber attack hit the city’s system, according to  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://abcnews.go.com/US/orleans-city-government-hit-cyberattack/story?id%3D67731695%23:~:text%3DNew%2520Orleans%2520Mayor%2520LaToya%2520Cantrell%2520speaks%2520to%2520reporters%2520after%2520the,Police%2520Department%2520Superintendent%2520Shaun%2520Ferguson.&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552751000&usg=AOvVaw2jYAB4nnTcwM0DzOLi0CvP'>an article in ABC News</a> . The attack impeded officials’ ability to enforce the regulations, Hill said, and the city was still grappling with recovery from the attack in March 2020 when the Covid-19 pandemic took priority.</p>
<p>The city did not respond immediately for comment.</p>
<p>Advocates like Hill and DeDecker are skeptical of the city’s  enforcement of these regulations even after the pandemic. Short-term rental operators are also now required to pay taxes to the city, and the office charged with enforcement, including the  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nola.gov/code-enforcement/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552752000&usg=AOvVaw2gictxJgzcasQuOs39GPq7'>Department of Code Enforcement </a> and the  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nola.gov/safety-and-permits/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552752000&usg=AOvVaw1nrIW3j7XclJXnuXvIU0e2'>Department of Safety and Permits</a> , is also now headed by Peter Bowen, the former head of Sonder, one of the largest short-term rental operators in the city, according to  <a href='https://www.google.com/url?q=https://thelensnola.org/2020/07/28/a-major-paradigm-shift-new-orleans-hires-former-short-term-rental-executive-to-lead-land-use-regulation-with-new-business-minded-approach/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1619410552752000&usg=AOvVaw3P6IPyMPlHHAkHXPNCNL2y'>an article by The Lens</a> .</p>
<p>“It's also worth noting that the city does have an incentive not to pursue [enforcement] as aggressively as it might otherwise because they recently passed [taxes],” Cashauna said. “What we prefer to see is stronger enforcement of the regulations that are currently in place, but given the fact of who you are going to see leading that work, we're not quite sure how realistic that hope is.”</p>
